## JPy
This is just a toy. The goal is to build a Python3 interpreter in Java.
At the moment, if you want to run a .py file, you must create a .pyj file using the script build.sh, the pass it as an argument to JPy.
Only a subset of bytecode instructions are supported.

This project was inspired by the article ["A Python Interpreter Written in Python" by Allison Kaptur](http://aosabook.org/en/500L/a-python-interpreter-written-in-python.html).
